  <strong>A Generalizable Benchmark for Continuous Plan-and-Execute Decision Making in Interactive Economies</strong>
</p>

## 🌟 Overview

Long-horizon planning is widely recognized as a core capability of autonomous LLM-based agents; however, current evaluation frameworks suffer from being largely episodic, domain-specific, or insufficiently grounded in persistent economic dynamics. We introduce **EcoGym**, a generalizable benchmark for continuous plan-and-execute decision making in interactive economies. 

EcoGym comprises three diverse environments: **Vending**, **Freelance**, and **Operation**, implemented in a unified decision-making process with standardized interfaces, and budgeted actions over an effectively unbounded horizon (1000+ steps if 365 day-loops for evaluation). The evaluation is based on business-relevant outcomes (e.g., net worth, income, and DAU), targeting long-term strategic coherence and robustness under partial observability and stochasticity.

Experiments across eleven leading LLMs expose a systematic tension: no single model dominates across all three scenarios. Critically, we find that models exhibit significant suboptimality in either high-level strategies or efficient action executions. EcoGym is released as an open, extensible testbed for transparent long-horizon agent evaluation and for studying controllability–utility trade-offs in realistic economic settings.

## 📊 Experimental Results

Our empirical evaluation on EcoGym reveals a significant performance gap in current LLMs: no single model consistently achieves superior performance across all scenarios, highlighting the inherent difficulty of long-horizon economic decision-making. Critically, we find that models exhibit significant suboptimality in either high-level strategies or efficient actions executions. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive suite of 8 diagnostic experiments or case studies, encompassing factors such as context window length, agent behavior patterns, additional memory modules, and human baselines.
